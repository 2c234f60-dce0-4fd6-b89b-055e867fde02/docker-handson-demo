# 05: Containerization

## Scenario

Contoso is a company that sells products for various outdoor activities. A marketing department of Contoso would like to launch a micro social media website to promote their products for existing and potential customers.

They now have both Java-based backend app and React-based frontend app. They want to make them containerized so that they can be deployed on any platform.

Now, as a DevOps engineer, you should containerize both apps using GitHub Copilot by copying the complete/step-00 directory to workshop and adding containerization.

## Prerequisites

Refer to the [README](../README.md) doc for preparation.

## Getting Started

- [Copy Base Application to Step-05](#copy-base-application-to-step-05)
- [Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](#check-github-copilot-agent-mode)
- [Prepare Custom Instructions](#prepare-custom-instructions)
- [Containerize Java Backend Application](#containerize-java-backend-application)
- [Containerize React Frontend Application](#containerize-react-frontend-application)
- [Orchestrate Containers](#orchestrate-containers)

### Copy Base Application to Step-05

1. First, copy the base application from `complete/step-00` to `workshop`:

   ```bash
   # From repository root
   cp -r complete/step-00 workshop
   ```

   This creates a new directory structure that you will enhance with containerization using GitHub Copilot.

### Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. Click the GitHub Copilot icon on the top of GitHub Codespace or VS Code and open GitHub Copilot window.

1. If you're asked to login or sign up, do it. It's free of charge.
1. Make sure you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

1. Select model to either `GPT-4.1` or `Claude Sonnet 4`.
1. Make sure that you've configured [MCP Servers](./00-setup.md#set-up-mcp-servers).

### Prepare Custom Instructions

1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy custom instructions.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp -r $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/custom-instructions/containerization/. \
          $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/custom-instructions/containerization/* `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/ -Recurse -Force
    ```

### Containerize Java Backend Application

1. Make sure that you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with the model of `Claude Sonnet 4` or `GPT-4.1`.
1. Use prompt like below to build a container image for the Java backend app.

    ```text
    I'd like to build a container image of a Java Spring Boot app. Follow the instructions below.

    - Identify all the steps first, which you're going to do.
    - The Java app is located at `workshop/backend`.
    - Your working directory is the repository root.
    - Create a Dockerfile in the `workshop/backend` directory.
    - Use Amazon Corretto JDK 17 Alpine for the build stage.
    - Use Amazon Corretto JRE 17 Alpine for the runtime stage.
    - Use multi-stage build approach.
    - Use the target port number of `8080` for the container image.
    - Create an SQLite database file, `sns_api.db`, in the container image. DO NOT copy the file from the host.
    - Add health check using the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint.
    - Run as non-root user for security.
    ```

1. Click the ![the keep button image](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep-blue) button of GitHub Copilot to take the changes.

1. Once `Dockerfile` is created, build the container image with the following prompt.

    ```text
    Use the Dockerfile in `workshop/backend` and build a container image.

    - Use `socialapp-backend` as the container image name.
    - Use `latest` as the container image tag.
    - Verify if the container image is built properly.
    - If the build fails, analyze the issues and fix them.
    ```

1. Click the ![the keep button image](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep-blue) button of GitHub Copilot to take the changes.

1. Once the build succeeds, run the container image with the following prompt.

    ```text
    Use the container image just built, run a container and verify if the app is running properly.
    
    - Use the host port of `8080` and map it to container port `8080`.
    - Verify the health endpoint is accessible.
    ```

### Containerize React Frontend Application

1. Make sure that you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with the model of `Claude Sonnet 4` or `GPT-4.1`.
2. Use the following prompt to build a container image for the React frontend app:

    ```text
    I'd like to build a container image of a React frontend app. Follow the instructions below.

    - Identify all the steps first, which you're going to do.
    - The frontend app is located at `workshop/frontend`.
    - Your working directory is the repository root.
    - Create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile` in the `workshop/frontend` directory.
    - Use Node.js 18-alpine for the build stage.
    - Use nginx:1.25-alpine for the production stage.
    - Use multi-stage build approach.
    - Build the app using `npm ci` and `npm run build`.
    - Serve the built files with Nginx.
    - Expose port `80` for the container image.
    - Copy and use the custom `nginx.conf` for routing and API proxy.
    - Run as non-root user for security.
    - Add health check endpoint.
    ```

3. Click the ![the keep button image](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep-blue) button of GitHub Copilot to take the changes.

4. Once `Dockerfile` is created, build the container image with the following prompt:

    ```text
    Use the Dockerfile in `workshop/frontend` and build a container image.

    - Use `socialapp-frontend` as the container image name.
    - Use `latest` as the container image tag.
    - Verify if the container image is built properly.
    - If the build fails, analyze the issues and fix them.
    ```

5. Click the ![the keep button image](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep-blue) button of GitHub Copilot to take the changes.

6. Once the build succeeds, run the container image with the following prompt:

    ```text
    Use the container image just built, run a container and verify if the app is running properly.
    
    - Use the host port of `3000` and map it to container port `80`.
    - Ensure the Nginx config proxies `/api` requests to the backend.
    ```

7. Make sure that both frontend and backend apps are NOT communicating with each other because they don't know each other yet. Run the prompt like below:

    ```text
    Remove both backend and frontend containers and their respective container images.
    ```

### Orchestrate Containers

1. Make sure that you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with the model of `Claude Sonnet 4` or `GPT-4.1`.
1. Use prompt like below to build a Docker Compose file.

    ```text
    I'd like to create a Docker Compose file. Follow the instructions below.
    
    - Identify all the steps first, which you're going to do.
    - Your working directory is the repository root.
    - Create `docker-compose.yml` in the `workshop` directory.
    - Use the Dockerfile in `./backend` for the backend service.
    - Use the Dockerfile in `./frontend` for the frontend service.
    - Use `socialapp-network` as the network name.
    - Use `socialapp-backend` as the container name of the Java app. Its target port is 8080, and host port is 8080.
    - Use `socialapp-frontend` as the container name of the React app. Its target port is 80, and host port is 3000.
    - Add environment variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker` to the backend container.
    - Add health checks for both services.
    - Add dependency so frontend waits for backend to be healthy.
    - Create a volume for backend data persistence.
    ```

1. Click the ![the keep button image](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep-blue) button of GitHub Copilot to take the changes.

1. Once the `docker-compose.yml` file is created, run it and verify if both apps are running properly.

    ```text
    Run the Docker compose file and verify if all the apps are running properly.
    
    - Navigate to the `workshop` directory.
    - Use `docker-compose up --build -d` to start the services.
    - Check the logs to ensure both services start successfully.
    - Verify both services are healthy.
    ```

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`, and verify if the apps are up and running properly and can communicate with each other.
